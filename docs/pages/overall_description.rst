Reproducible Scalable Pipeline For Amplicon-based Metagenomics (RST4ABM)
==========================================================================

RST4ABM is a Snakemake-based pipeline designed for convenient, reproducible and scalable amplicon-based (16S rRNA or ITS) metagenomics. It processes reads in *.fastq* format or
